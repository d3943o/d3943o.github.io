### CPSC 120

* Lab 2
    Lab 2, Part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was an introduction to my programming in general. I was able to use variable and assign them to different words in order to produce a specific outcome. 

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, Part 2 was my second favorite lab because it exemplified the idea of using float numbers. While making a calculator, it helps me understand how I can make the input of a decimal into a number and the remainder as a fraction. 

* Lab 6
    Lab 6, Part 2 was my third favorite lab due to the fact that it was based off of creating a Guessing Game. Although I struggled in creating this program, it was fun testing the inputs/outputs in order to create a pattern of outcomes to help get closer to the number.
